        <p class="paragraph">This was a giant of an occasion, but a midget of a match. After all the weeks of anticipation, the days of travel as fans journeyed across India and from its diaspora towards the homing beacon this epic bowl had become, and the hours as they filed and then flooded into the ground, in cricket terms it was decided in little more than the blink of an eye, the time it took for Pakistan to crumble.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">With almost no Pakistani presence in the stands the game ended up almost as one-sided as the crowd. Mickey Arthur, Pakistan’s team manager, complained that “it didn’t seem like an ICC event to be brutally honest – it seemed like a BCCI event”, but admitted his side “went into our shells a little bit”.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Pakistan now have a 0-8 record in these matches at World Cups – this was not the first time they have shrunk to the occasion. But midway through the 30th over they were 155 for two, Babar Azam had just reached his half-century and Mohammad Rizwan’s was not far away. They had scored slowly, but importantly they had not lost wickets, had two set batters and seemed poised to post a challenging score.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From that moment they faced 78 balls, scored 36 runs and lost eight wickets. After Babar and Rizwan’s partnership of 82 came sequels of seven, four, two, three, 16, none and three. There was good bowling and good captaincy – as soon as Pakistan started reeling Rohit Sharma rushed Jasprit Bumrah back to deliver the knockout blows – but the team in green ended with a total to match their miserable resistance. “We’ve had success by taking it deep and then cashing in at the back end,” said Arthur. “That’s been our style, that’s been our brand. But we didn’t play the Pakistan way tonight.”<br>

Only twice in the past 20 years, both in 2011, have a team successfully defended a total below 200 at the World Cup, and this never looked likely to become a third, not with Rohit in this kind of mood. He hit his first ball for four and by the time he was out, 63 balls, six fours, six sixes and 86 runs later, India were 36 from victory, whereupon Shreyas Iyer assumed control. Rohit’s was an innings of ambition, sweet timing and occasionally sheer contempt, in which he did some particularly mean things to Haris Rauf. “For us, it was an opposition we wanted to play,” Rohit said. For Pakistan, it seemed an opposition they wanted to flee from.</p>
